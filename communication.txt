Please decide how to communicate (team members can edit this file.)

Some Suggestions:

Twitter: Setup a twitter account that any team member can post to.  This allows everyone to communicate at their leisure and provide a full history of what has been said.

IM/Hangouts/IRC: Share everyone's hangout/IM/IRC account so people can communicate in real time.

email: share everyone's email account to send message back and forth.

You may setup physical meetings, but keep in mind that the online user(s) will need to have a virtual presence!

Team choice (edit below this line):

Hello Team,
 This is Shawn. I would like to recommend using email since I am an online student. I think between email and sharing phone contact numbers it should provide enough communication while also providing the documentation we need. Any other suggestions? -Shawn 2/6/16, 08:18.

!!!Hello,

This is Martin.  I have trouble logging on to my account as of right now.  My phone number is 8437542203.   I also can do google hangouts if thats okay.  Sorry for the delay

UPDATE---

Hey we're discussing about merging both game board groups, and the other two classmates I've spoken to agree, we are just waiting on our online classmates to decide if you guys also want to merge both groups.  If you dont understand exactly whats going on, please email professor West about this as he mentioned this to me.    I think it's going to be worth it, so i vote yes on this.
